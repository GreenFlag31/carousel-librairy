# Carousel

- Since styling personalisation possibilities are almost endless, I've chosen not to add style properties (such as "light theme" or "dark theme").
  If you want to change default style, just erase existing style of the carousel by adding "encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None" in the component hosting the carousel.
  Following example will erase the (default) blue background arrows :
  <!-- .carousel-container .previous,
  .carousel-container .next {
  background: red;
  } -->
